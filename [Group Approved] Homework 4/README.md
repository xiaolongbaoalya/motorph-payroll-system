**Homework # 4**

**dev-red**: Restructured code for MS1 in accordance to mentor's feedback.

**dev-aly:** Created code for View All Employee output, Employee Details, and Calculation prompt.

**dev-christine**: Converted dev-red and incorporated dev-aly's code into GUI. Used dev-aly's initial code to build add employee GUI which reflects the data once added. Test run is also included

**dev-felice**: Refined GUI based on CHR2 requests for window for compliance when Compute Payroll is triggered. Did full QA Testing for both MS1 and HW # 4.

**dev-shane:** Restructured the GUI code so that the payroll generation functionality now takes place within the same frame as the 'View Employee Details' frame, instead of opening a separate window.
