Enhancements Made to the Payroll System GUI 
1**. Main Window (Login Screen)**
 Added MotorPH Logo: I added the MotorPH company logo at the top of the main window to make the application look more professional and to match MotorPH's overall branding.
 Change Buttons color: I changed all the main and small buttons to use (#1c3680) to match MotorPh's logo color
 Employee Login Dialog The dialog now has more padding and spacing, making it look less cramped.

**2. Employee Dashboard Section Headers: **
 I added bold section headers for “Basic Information” and “Compensations” so users can easily distinguish between the two sections. 
 Both headers are the same size for consistency. 
 Dialog Size Adjustment: The height of the Employee Dashboard dialog was increased. 


**6. General Improvements Consistent Fonts:**
 I used the Segoe UI font throughout the application for a modern and professional look.
