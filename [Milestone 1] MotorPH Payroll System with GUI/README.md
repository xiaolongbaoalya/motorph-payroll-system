**Milestone 1 Overview**

**dev-aly**, **dev-felice**, and **dev-red** collaborated to restructure the class diagram, providing a clear blueprint for dev-red to follow in reorganizing the system code.

**dev-red:** took the lead in refactoring the CP1 codebase to align with Java standards, introducing modular class structures and incorporating mentor feedback.

**dev-aly:** designed the initial landing page and dashboard interface. While the finalized landing page design was not integrated (due to its deviation from the MPHCR01 scope), it remains available under dev-aly folder.

**dev-christine:** translated the refactored CP1 code into a Java Swing GUI and developed a prototype.

**dev-felice:** improved the interface originally built by dev-christine, making it more polished and user-friendly, and also conducted quality assurance testing.

**dev-shane:** finalized the Milestone 1 version by improving the GUI flow.

**MPHCR02 Implementation (Milestone 1 Refinements)**

**dev-red** updated the code to meet all MPHCR02 change request requirements.

**dev-aly** began work on the MPHCR02 GUI layout, initially excluding the "Add Employee".

**dev-christine** implemented the “Add Employee” GUI functionality and integrated it into the current build.

**dev-felice** further refined the updated GUI, ran QA testing to ensure compliance, and made several UI improvements for better usability and consistency.

**dev-shanev** finalized the GUI layout and interaction flow, and also addressed and resolved the QA issues reported by dev-felice.

**Submission incident*

The original Milestone 1 folder and GUI were removed during submission by a group member. A new folder containing **dev-red**'s updated code was uploaded, but it only included the standalone GUI for Change Request 2, not the version integrated with the full payroll system. After consulting our mentor, we were advised to simply reorganize the files. We've since corrected the structure, and everything is now in order.
