**Enhancements Made to the Payroll System GUI**

**dev-red:** Restructured CP1 code according to class.

**dev-christine:** Converted restructured CP1 code to GUI. Uploaded zipped folder GUI Prototype.

**dev-felice:** Created + updated all helper dialogs (styleButton, styleButtonSmall, etc) and added some imports and set the GUI parameters. Also created/updated current GUI (showAdminMenu GUI, salaryCalculationMenu GUI, etc.) after initial GUI by dev-christine

**dev-aly:** Created the landing page and dashboard view. Official landing page still not added due to complexity, can be viewed under dev-aly

**dev-shane:** Restructured the GUI code so that the payroll generation functionality now takes place within the same frame as the 'View Employee Details' frame, instead of opening a separate window.
