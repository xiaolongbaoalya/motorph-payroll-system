**Enhancements Made to the Payroll System GUI**

**dev-red:** Restructured CP1 code according to class.

**dev-aly:** Created the landing page and dashboard view. Official landing page still not added due to complexity, can be viewed under dev-aly.

**dev-christine:** Converted restructured CP1 code to GUI. Uploaded zipped folder GUI Prototype.

**dev-felice:** Created + updated all helper dialogs (styleButton, styleButtonSmall, etc) and added some imports and set the GUI parameters. Also created/updated current GUI (showAdminMenu GUI, salaryCalculationMenu GUI, etc.) after initial GUI by dev-christine. 

**dev-shane:** Restructured the GUI code so that the payroll generation functionality now takes place within the same frame as the 'View Employee Details' frame, instead of opening a separate window.

**Refined MS1**

**dev-red:** Restructured code for MS1 in accordance to mentor's feedback.

**dev-aly:** Created the landing page and dashboard view. Official landing page still not added due to complexity, can be viewed under dev-aly. Finished code for View All Employee output, Employee Details, and Calculation prompt.

**dev-christine:** Converted dev-red and incorporated dev-aly's code into GUI. Used dev-aly's initial code to build add employee GUI which reflects the data once added. Test run is also included

**dev-felice:** Refined GUI based on CHR2 requests for window for compliance when Compute Payroll is triggered. Did full QA Testing for both MS1 and HW # 4.

**dev-shane:** Restructured the GUI code so that the payroll generation functionality now takes place within the same frame as the 'View Employee Details' frame, instead of opening a separate window.

**Incident Report**

Milestone 1 and its original GUI were deleted. A new Milestone 1 folder was uploaded containing Red’s updated code, but it currently includes only the GUI for Change Request 2 (the Chr2gui1.java), not the full GUI for the entire payroll system.

The MainGUI in the dev folder is based on Red’s updated code. While it is a complete GUI tailored for Change Request 2, it is not the original GUI we created for Milestone 1. That said, since it serves as the current MainGUI, it should still be placed in the Milestone 1 folder along with the rest of the build.

Chr2gui1 is currently located in the Milestone 1 folder, but it actually belongs in Homework 4, along with a fully integrated version that works with the complete payroll system GUI (which we currently don’t have).

Additionally, the MainGUI in dev is not the version we originally planned to submit. The correct version should display the monthly salary result directly below the month/year input fields, rather than opening it in a new window.

Note: Chr2gui1 is a standalone build specifically for Change Request 2 and does not contain the full payroll system.
