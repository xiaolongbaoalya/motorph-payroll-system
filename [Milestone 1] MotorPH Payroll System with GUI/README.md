## 🚧 Milestone 1 Overview

- **dev-aly**, **dev-felice**, and **dev-red** collaborated to restructure the class diagram, providing a clear blueprint for **dev-red** to follow in reorganizing the system code.

- **dev-red**  
  Took the lead in refactoring the CP1 codebase to align with Java standards, introducing modular class structures and incorporating mentor feedback.

- **dev-aly**  
  Designed the initial landing page and dashboard interface. While the finalized landing page design was not integrated (due to its deviation from the MPHCR01 scope), it remains available in the `dev-aly` folder.

- **dev-christine**  
  Translated the refactored CP1 code into a Java Swing GUI and developed a working prototype.

- **dev-felice**  
  Improved the interface originally built by **dev-christine**, making it more polished and user-friendly, and also conducted quality assurance testing.

- **dev-shane**  
  Finalized the Milestone 1 version by improving the overall GUI flow.

## 🔧 MPHCR02 Implementation (Milestone 1 Refinements)

- **dev-red**  
  Updated the core codebase to fulfill all MPHCR02 requirements.

- **dev-aly**  
  Initiated the GUI layout for MPHCR02, with the initial version excluding the “Add Employee” feature.

- **dev-christine**  
  Implemented the “Add Employee” GUI functionality and successfully integrated it into the current build.

- **dev-felice**  
  Refined the updated GUI, conducted QA testing to ensure compliance, and improved the interface for better usability and consistency.

- **dev-shane**  
  Finalized the overall GUI layout and interaction flow, resolved the QA issues raised by **dev-felice**, and developed additional GUIs to meet MPHCR02 requirements.

## 📁 Submission Incident

The original Milestone 1 folder and GUI were removed during submission by a group member. A new folder containing **dev-red**'s updated code was uploaded, but it only included the standalone GUI for Change Request 2—not the version integrated with the full payroll system. After consulting our mentor, we were advised to simply reorganize the files. We've since corrected the structure, and everything is now in order.
